Aqirito is the only brother I have. He is my only siblings. Initially, I cared little for my brother but eventually opens up to him. I normally very quiet and tends to use a speaker to be heard, but whenever I am on webcam drawing live, I'm more lively (though still careful to hide my face). I'm also a neat person who keeps my things clean. I was easily prone to anger and jealousy and was more worried and possessive about the person I love, more than I would admit, to the point that I sometimes throws tantrums.I hopes to watch an anime created by me and my borther together. I have a nickname called Eromanga, due to my shyness, I refuses to call myself Eromanga because of how perverted the name sounds and denies having such a perverted name; despite that, I admits that I enjoys drawing erotic images. I is also stubborn when my borther forgot to bring me a food for a few days, I refused to leave my room to get food because I felt like I'd have lost."
